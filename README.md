Welcome to my page!
I'm Shriya, a Data enthusiast from Boston, USA.

When it comes to analysing, I'm passionate about using data to create tools that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable. From innovative data solutions to cutting-edge research papers, I love pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of data analytics. Whether it's analyzing sentiment on social media or optimizing data jobs, I enjoy using my skills to drive meaningful insights and improve business outcomes. Let's explore the power of data together and see what new frontiers we can uncover!

But when the workday's over, you can usually find me embarking on some wild and wacky adventure. Whether I'm kayaking down a roaring river, hiking up a majestic mountain, or simply enjoying a good old-fashioned game of Dungeons & Dragons, I'm always seeking out new ways to feed my insatiable curiosity.

My goal is to travel the world with just one bag. When Iâ€™m not on a computer, Iâ€™m probably making pour-over coffee or practicing my zombie apocalypse skills, just not at the same time since shooting arrows through zombie heads makes maintaining a steady pour rate rather difficult.
